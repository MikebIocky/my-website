# Website for my blog 

The blog design & codebase is based on summi's repo, check his stuffs out there! [link](https://github.com/sumitdotml/website)


## To-Do

- [ ] Make the navbar sticky for mobile and make the navbar move its original Y position a little higher and stick to the very top when the user scrolls down
- [ ] Add a search bar
- [ ] Add a graph visualization (similar to the [Obsidian graph view](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view))
- [ ] Add a "On this page" (like a ToC) section to the top right of the page in the PC version. It should be hidden on mobile.
