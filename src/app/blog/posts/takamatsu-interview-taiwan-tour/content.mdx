Arriving in **Taipei just the day before**, she immersed herself in Taiwanese culture with a visit to the prestigious **National Palace Museum**.

When playfully probed about which character's high school experience she'd love to relive, a thoughtful pause followed.  Then, with a twinkle in her eye, she revealed, "You know, maybe **Tsukasa**? He's undeniably cool, isn't he?  There's this wonderful balance of charm and grounded masculinity about him...  Living a youth like his, filled with that effortless charisma, seems like an absolute blast."

Before the eager fans gathered, Takamatsu-sensei graciously shared a moment for an intimate interview, offering a glimpse into the soul of *Skip and Loafer*.  She emphasized that while the manga carries the shojo label, its heart beats to a rhythm far beyond simple romance.

"Looking back at my own school days, love was just one thread in a much larger, vibrant tapestry," she reflected. "There were the exhilarating highs of **club activities**, the collective energy of **culture festivals**, and that all-consuming passion you pour into **the things you truly love**.  Through conversations with so many people, I realized the beautiful kaleidoscope of perspectives that exist.  My aim was to capture that intricate balance of life's elements within the story."

And the enigmatic title, *Skip and Loafer* (*スキップとローファー*)?  She unveiled its charming origins:

"I chose *Loafer* because it's such a quintessential **school shoe**, instantly evoking that **high school atmosphere**.  And *Skip*?  That embodies a feeling of **lighthearted freedom**, of **not being weighed down by rigid expectations**.  It might seem like an unexpected pairing at first glance, but if it resonates with the effervescent spirit of youth, then it's absolutely perfect!"

When asked about her connection to her characters, her response was beautifully insightful:

"They don't feel like my 'children' in the way some creators describe," she mused. "They are, in my mind, their **own distinct individuals**.  Considering the age gap between us, I see them as beings caught in that fascinating space between childhood and adulthood—half-child, half-adult, navigating their own paths."

She admitted she doesn't often ponder what advice she'd give them, but when pressed, a profound message emerged:

"If I could whisper something to them, it would be: **'It's okay to stumble, to fall.  Those moments of failure, of perceived setbacks, are simply integral steps in the beautiful, messy process of growing up.'**"

This powerful sentiment, she revealed, is the very core message she hopes to impart to her readers, a gentle reminder that imperfection is not just acceptable, but essential.

Regarding **character development**, she emphasized the meticulous planning behind their emotional journeys.  Even with characters like **Shima and Kazakami-senpai**, blessed with striking good looks, she deliberately introduced **humanizing flaws**.  Her intention was clear: to portray them as **genuine individuals**, not mere cardboard cutouts of perfection.

"I believe it's crucial to showcase how even those who seem to have it all together react when **life throws them curveballs**.  It's in those moments of vulnerability and struggle that true growth blossoms, and I deeply hope readers can connect with that authenticity."

The conversation naturally drifted to the comforting realm of food, specifically the evocative power of **hometown flavors** and culinary nostalgia.

Takamatsu-sensei's face lit up as she joyfully declared that she had **finally experienced the magic of xiaolongbao in Taiwan**!

"I think we all have **that one dish**, that single bite, that instantly transports us back to the warmth of home, wherever that may be," she shared with a nostalgic smile. "Big cities are dazzling with their endless culinary innovations, but sometimes, your soul simply craves **the uncomplicated comfort of something familiar, something real.**"

She then shared a heartwarming anecdote:

"There was a small dumpling shop I once mentioned in my manga, almost in passing. Sadly, it closed its doors sometime later. But then, incredibly, the owner's son **reached out to me with a letter**. He had seen my work and was so touched, he even included a photograph of their dumplings. That simple gesture resonated so deeply—it was profoundly moving."

Mitsumi, *Skip and Loafer*'s endearing protagonist, boldly defies the **traditional shojo heroine mold**.  She doesn't embody that conventional, often narrow definition of "cute."  Yet, in Takamatsu-sensei's eyes, Mitsumi is undeniably, radiantly adorable.

"If readers perceive Mitsumi as cute, it fills me with immense joy!" she exclaimed. "There's such a vast spectrum of what 'cute' can be, and I'm eager to **challenge and expand the limiting stereotypes** of what society deems 'cute'."

For **character designs and hairstyles**, meticulous consideration is given to what **each character would authentically gravitate towards**.  Takamatsu-sensei even delves into **research** to ensure those visual details ring true.

When it comes to crafting **emotionally resonant storytelling**, Takamatsu-sensei is a master of **pacing and visual rhythm**.  She intuitively adjusts the **paneling and detail** to amplify the impact of key moments.  Some scenes demand intricate detail to fully bloom, while others whisper their meaning through elegant simplicity.

One scene that holds particular significance for her?

"The moment when **Mitsumi and Shima experience a temporary separation**. That poignant interlude was something I had always felt compelled to draw, to explore the vulnerability within connection."

Echoing her earlier sentiment, she reiterated her belief that characters shouldn't exist in a perpetual state of flawless perfection.  They must navigate the complexities of **setbacks and missteps** to truly resonate with the human experience.

"I confess, I was actually quite anxious that readers might turn against **Shima** during that particular arc, fearing his actions would be misconstrued," she admitted with refreshing honesty. "But to my delightful surprise, the overwhelming response was continued affection and understanding for him!  That genuinely caught me off guard, in the best possible way."

Turning to the **anime adaptation**, Takamatsu-sensei's enthusiasm was palpable:

"I truly believe the anime adaptation **perfectly captured the very essence of the emotions I poured into the manga**.  Watching it, I felt an incredible sense of peace and resonance, as if my inner world had been translated onto the screen with such care."

When playfully asked if she’d be tempted to join in the anime's infectious **dance sequence**, a burst of laughter erupted, followed by a decisive **crossing of arms in an X**:

"Absolutely not!  Dancing is definitely not in my repertoire!"

However, one particular moment in the anime deeply **moved her soul**:

"The scene where **Mitsumi is running**. In the manga, it's conveyed in a single page, a fleeting moment. But in the anime, the studio breathed life into it with **such breathtaking artistry and emotional depth**. That scene truly resonated within me, it was profoundly moving."

---

As the event drew to a close, **Takamatsu-sensei, with genuine warmth and sincerity, once again extended her heartfelt gratitude** to the ocean of fans before her.

"To witness *Skip and Loafer* being embraced and published across borders is a dream realized," she shared, her voice filled with emotion. "And to have this precious opportunity to meet and connect with all of you in person… it's beyond words.  Thank you, from the bottom of my heart, for your unwavering support!"

In a final, cherished gesture, she **graced everyone with one last sketch of Mitsumi**, a heartfelt parting gift etched in ink and affection.
