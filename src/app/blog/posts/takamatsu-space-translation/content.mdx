**(00:07:17)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Hello? Hello? … Was my mic off? Can you hear me now? If you can hear me, please give me some kind of response. If you can hear me, could you say something?
… You can hear me? Okay, good.

**(00:07:44)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** …Nothing?

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I’ve been talking by myself until just now. Can you hear me?

**(00:07:48)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** If you can hear me, please react.
Ah—there it is?

**(00:07:50)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Finally!

**(00:07:53)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** So, I’ve been talking all alone for a while now.

**(00:07:58)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Um… so, Aiko-san, are you here?

**(00:08:07)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you so much for being here. Sorry it’s so late. Yesterday, I got to have a signing event at **Junkudō Ikebukuro** after they started doing events again. They kindly let me do it. I really appreciate that. Apparently, only a tiny handful of people were able to come—hardly anyone. So…

**(00:08:50)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** For those who couldn’t attend, if you have questions, I’d like to answer them here. Also, I want to say, “Please apply again next time!” I’d really like to do another event, so I hope to see you all in person one day. So yes, feel free to send in questions.

## **Q&A Begins**

**Q:** “I’d like to know your favorite manga. I’m always cheering you on!”

**(00:09:01)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you so much for the question. I have so many manga I love. Recently, I participated in a **Fujiko F. Fujio Tribute**. They reached out to me partly because I kept saying how much I loved his works, especially his short stories for grown-ups. Of course, I also love **Doraemon** and read it obsessively. All of those are highly recommended.

Another thing: there’s a new edition of **Animal Doctor (Dōbutsu no Oisha-san)**, so I’ve been buying and rereading it little by little. I read it back in the day, but I loved it enough to buy the new edition and read it again.

**Q:** “I couldn’t attend your signing event, but I always enjoy your manga. Thank you! I’d love to ask: in your opinion, what’s the most important thing in human relationships?”

**(00:10:42)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you! As far as “most important thing” goes… Well, I do write about human relationships, but I’m not really an expert myself. When I was in my teens, I was so self-conscious and overthought everything, so I actually handled relationships pretty poorly back then.

But if I had to pick something, I’d say: Don’t over-imagine what the other person might be thinking. I personally imagine way too much, which can be counterproductive. It’s good to have some empathy—like, “They might feel this way”—but you can never fully know someone’s exact feelings. So if you fixate on your assumptions, you can end up getting irrationally angry or jumping to the wrong conclusion. Instead, try to accept things calmly as they come. That’s my best advice.

**Q:** “Thank you for all your hard work. When do you have the most fun drawing manga?”

**(00:12:19)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I think the best moment is after I finish everything—when the chapter is finally complete. While I’m in the middle of drawing, I do enjoy certain scenes, but there are also panels that feel tedious or that I can’t get right, which drives me up the wall. So the process itself isn’t always fun. But looking back when it’s done, I can be like, “Oh, that was actually kinda fun!”

As for a favorite stage, lately I do enjoy inking (pen work), because I can chat with friends while I ink and it’s pretty relaxing.

**(00:13:14)**

(Reading a fan comment) “Congratulations on getting a second season of the anime!”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you so much.

**Q:** “Will you do a signing event in Kansai? I’d really love for you to come.”

**(00:13:41)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** About signings: the recent event at Junkudō happened because I said, “I’d like to do a signing,” and they made it happen. Typically, bookstores send the offer, and if I agree, we do it. So maybe when Volume 12 comes out, if a bookstore in the Kansai region says, “Let’s do one,” we’ll do it! I’d really like to go. Also, I’d love to do one in the Hokuriku region (my hometown area), like Ishikawa Prefecture, since it appears in the story.

**Q:** “I couldn’t attend the signing. Will there be another chance?”

**(00:14:30)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Yes, I definitely plan to hold more, so it’s not just going to be a one-time thing.

**(00:15:00)**

(Reading a comment) “Thank you for hosting this Space. Do you have any recent hobbies you’re into? I want a new hobby this year, so I’d love to hear yours.”

**(00:15:07)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Well, not super recently—because after I got my dog, I haven’t done it much—but I was playing the ukulele. I totally recommend the ukulele. I bought one about two years ago. I always wanted to play guitar, but guitars are big and I was afraid I’d give it up, so I started with ukulele. It’s got only four strings, and they’re softer, so it’s easy to pick up. It’s really fun. But lately, my dog is scared of it, so I haven’t played for a while…

Another one: I’ve been traveling overseas more, so I signed up for a year of online English lessons. But I skipped the last two months! (laughs) I promise I’ll resume this month.

**(00:16:32)**

(Reading) “I love the flow from Volume 10 to 11 in Skip and Loafer. Everyone’s growth is incredible. Which character is closest to you personally?”

**(00:16:56)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Hmm, I think I’m most similar to Mika and Makoto. Shima-kun is probably the furthest from me.

**Q:** “What’s your favorite spot in your hometown?”

**(00:17:21)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I’m from the Hokuriku region. I went to college in Kanazawa. After everything calms down, I hope people will visit. My actual birthplace is Toyama Prefecture, so if we’re talking about Toyama… maybe Tateyama is pretty, or **Kurobe-Unazuki Onsen Station** if you want to jump right into a hot spring. They have a scenic trolley in **Kurobe Gorge**, which is amazing in the fall. If you get a chance, definitely check it out!

**(00:19:03)**

(Reading) “I’m desperate to know your skincare routine and favorite makeup.”

**(00:19:05)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Ha ha, well, to be frank, I sometimes think: “Instead of buying fancy lotions, maybe it’s cheaper to go get laser treatment to zap spots at a clinic!” (laughs) But yes, daily sunscreen is important.

**Q:** “Have you watched any interesting anime lately?”

**(00:19:57 → 00:20:00)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Let’s see… I haven’t had time for new anime. I’ve mostly been reading manga. I recently finished **Natsume Arata no Kekkon** (by Taro Nogizaka), and I really liked it. For live-action, I’m watching **Dr. House** (the American medical drama also known as **House, M.D.**) and **Grand Maison Tokyo** (a Japanese TV drama about a French restaurant). I discovered **Grand Maison Tokyo** on streaming, and it was great. For anime, I worry about being influenced by other works, so I hold off sometimes. But I do want to watch **Nintama Rantaro** or **Moana 2** if that happens.

**(00:21:29)**

(Reading a fan comment) “I’m a student in Ishikawa. I saw someone with a Skip & Loafer keychain on their bag, struck up a conversation, and we became friends. We recently went to a bookstore to plug your stuff. Thank you for creating this. Hoping to see you in Ishikawa!”

**(00:22:12)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** That’s wonderful! I’m so happy hearing that. Good on you for making a new friend.

(Reading another)

“Come to Fukuoka too!”

**(00:22:28)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Yes, I’d love to. Fukuoka is awesome.

**Q:** “In the newest volume, I was swooning over Shima-kun, and also thinking, ‘Wow, that’s a pretty freewheeling school trip!’ Was it based on a real-life school? It’s so laid-back.”

**(00:22:31)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Yes, I referenced several. The idea is that Mitsumi’s school is academically high-level, so I asked folks from top-ranked high schools. Some allow students a lot of freedom because the kids are serious and don’t cause trouble—like they can explore at night, or even plan their own itineraries. My own school trip was basically nonexistent, so I was really envious researching all that.

**(00:24:13)**

(Reading) “Egoshi-san: ‘Good evening, I missed your signing, so I came to listen. I’m leaving for now. Bye.’”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** “Wait, Egoshi-san, that’s not a question—just come next time to the signing, haha. Thank you for dropping by.”

**(00:24:37)**

(Reading) “When you’re drawing, do you snack or drink, or do you go without eating to focus? Also, any current favorite sweets?”

**(00:24:49)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I keep snacks and drinks nearby, but I know I focus better if I don’t eat. If I eat too much, I get sleepy. So ideally, I shouldn’t. But in reality, I nibble constantly, lose focus, nibble again, etc.

A current favorite sweet: I might’ve mentioned this, but **Otoemon** is a shop that makes pound cakes with chestnuts. They also do a fruit pound cake. In winter, it’s called “King’s Fruitcake,” and in summer, it’s “Queen’s Fruitcake,” which has passion fruit. If you like dried fruit, it’s a must-try.

(Reading) “Do you use a retractable leash for Anko (your dog)?”

**(00:25:56)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I have one, but my dog is so small that it doesn’t work well for us. I use a standard non-retractable leash.

**(00:26:27)**

(Reading) “In Chapter 51, Mitsumi was a panda on the opening page. Is that referencing a Maroon 5 album cover?”

**(00:26:50)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** No, it wasn’t. That’s news to me! I’ll look into it. (laughs)

**(00:27:10)**

(Referring to the earlier mic troubles)

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thanks again to the person who pointed out my mic was off earlier. Otherwise, I’d have kept talking to myself.

**Q:** “Do you already know how Skip and Loafer will end?”

**(00:27:12)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you. I have a vague idea, but some things I’d initially planned turned out differently. Not because I specifically wanted to change them, but they just naturally shifted from my early concept. So I do have a rough sense of how it might end, but it could also turn out differently.

**(00:28:30)**

(Reading) “I love how you set real-world locations like Ueno Zoo. It makes Mitsumi’s world feel so close. How do you decide which places to use?”

**(00:28:50)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I’ll plan something like “I want them to go on a date in this general style,” then go location-scouting. If it seems workable, I incorporate it. For Kyoto, I took a trip to see certain places, but once I decided “I want them to drop by a certain café,” I made a second trip specifically for that. I popped into five or six cafés in one day to find the best vibe for the manga. That’s usually how I do it.

**(00:29:56 → 00:30:20)**

(Reading) “I missed the signing, but I’m still reading your manga. You depict people’s feelings so well—how do you come up with those delicate emotions?”

**(00:31:00)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you. But really, I’m limited by my own experiences. I do try to recall the words and behaviors of various people I’ve encountered, and I kind of blend them all together.

Mitsumi-chan is, for instance, a fundamentally nice person. But if I only showed her nice side, it’d feel unrealistic. So I try to add some embarrassing or introspective aspects from my own experiences. Meanwhile, times of feeling “Wow, that’s so cool!” or “That was so kind!” are often from moments I witnessed from friends or even strangers. I gather all those things.

If a character’s always doing something really wonderful, it might feel a bit braggy if it’s too tied to my own personal achievements, so I try to pick up the good from other people’s actions, the bad from my own, etc.

**(00:33:05)**

(Apology for possibly skipping questions asked while the mic was off)

**(00:33:30)**

(Reading) “Your manga made me want to visit Ishikawa. Could you recommend any local foods or sightseeing in Ishikawa?”

**(00:33:42)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Sure. I was a college student in Kanazawa, but I had little money back then, so I didn’t explore a ton. If you go, you might pair Kanazawa with the Noto Peninsula—but be aware they’re two hours apart by car. Noto was recently hit by an earthquake, so if you can volunteer or if tourism is open, that’s great.

In Kanazawa, one place I used to frequent was a coffee shop near Omichō Market called **Higashide Coffee (Higashide Kōhī)**, which has yummy pudding. Also, the **21st Century Museum of Contemporary Art** is cool, though it can be crowded. Sometimes on Friday nights it’s less busy. I love the atmosphere at night.

**(00:36:24)**

(Reading) “I’ve reread your manga many times. In the Kyoto school trip story, is the café Shima and Mitsumi visited a real place? It looked so cute.”

**(00:36:30)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Yes, I actually went there in real life. It was delicious. Kyoto has so many cafés. I only scratched the surface.

**(00:37:19)**

(Reading) “Any special memories of the Kansai region?”

**(00:37:24)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Yes, for research, I visited Osaka and Nara. Typically for a school trip, you stay in Kyoto and do day trips to Osaka or Nara. I’ve gone twice. The first time, I brought an assistant who’s worked with me from the start. We took a camera and checked out all these places that high schoolers might visit, including a wagashi (traditional sweets) workshop. It was super fun.

The second time, I went again and spent more time in both. Some didn’t make it into the manga, but everything was delicious. Nara’s shrines and temples were gorgeous—didn’t have time to see them all, so I’d love to go back.

**(00:39:45)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Today’s the last day of a three-day weekend, so I don’t want to keep people up too late. I’ll probably wrap up soon.

(Reading) “I love Mukai-kun—he’s my favorite. Will you ever focus on him?”

**(00:40:18)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** The thing about focusing on a character is that it often requires a moment where their heart is shaken. Mukai-kun is a pretty self-sufficient guy, so he hasn’t had a major shake-up yet. But if the timing feels right, I’d love to try it. Sometimes I end up writing about characters I never intended to, so who knows. Thank you.

**(00:40:47)**

(Reading) “I love Nao-chan and Mika-chan. Were they inspired by anyone real?”

**(00:41:01)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Not exactly. Everyone in my manga is a mashup of various real people I’ve known or observed.

**(00:42:30)**

(Reading) “Thank you for hosting this Space. I adore your art style—it’s so cute. Where does that cuteness come from?”

**(00:42:43)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you. I’ve read lots of shōjo, shōnen, and seinen manga, so I’m not sure which influence is strongest. Because Skip and Loafer runs in a seinen magazine but has a warm, bright tone, I tried to simplify lines for a poppy, light feeling. I read a bunch of shōjo manga for reference, so that probably helped shape the cuteness.

**(00:44:00)**

(Reading) “Last Valentine’s Day, you said Mukai-kun received the most chocolates from fans. Who got second place?”

**(00:44:05)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Well, it’s not like there were a huge number of chocolates sent in, but the next most popular were Shima-kun and Kanechika-senpai. I don’t think many others got anything, actually.

But here’s the thing: I feel like, compared to fans of Shima-kun, fans of Mukai-kun or Kanechika-senpai tend to have… how do I put this? A stronger sense of devotion. It’s a bit funny how this mirrors the dynamics in the story, right? In terms of image, Shima-kun is obviously popular, but ironically, the real “main love” feeling might come from fans of Mukai or Kanechika-senpai.

(Reading) “I’ve only ever watched one anime all the way through—Skip and Loafer. Do you still stay in touch with your high school friends? You strike me as someone with tons of friends.”

**(00:45:42)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I do keep up with a handful, but I don’t have that many. (laughs) Actually, a lot of people who had tons of friends in school only see a few close ones as adults. Quality over quantity, right?

(Reading) “What about living with a dog surprised you the most versus your original image of dogs?”

**(00:47:15)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I guess I never knew how unbelievably adorable they actually are. Like, a billion times cuter than I imagined. I hadn’t formed a strong idea of dogs beforehand, so there wasn’t a big “Wow, that’s different!” moment; it was more like “I never realized just how expressive and perceptive they can be.” But the top takeaway is definitely how cute they are.

**(00:48:39)**

(Some confusion about reading comments…)

**(00:49:07)**

(Reading) “I love the Skip and Loafer manga and anime. The opening theme, ‘Mellow’ by **Keina Suda**, fits perfectly. How did you feel hearing it the first time?”

**(00:49:18)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** When I first heard it, I thought it matched so well! At the same time, I was like, “Oh my gosh, someone wrote a song specifically for my manga?!” I felt excitement, embarrassment, gratitude—so many emotions. It was also interesting to realize, “Ah, so that’s how the singer (Suda-san) interprets this story.”

I listened to it countless times. Even though I seldom go to karaoke, I decided that whenever I do, I have to sing it. It’s such a good song—really refreshing. And it made me think, “Wow, that’s so Shima-kun!”

**(00:51:13)**

(Reading) “Hey sensei, in the latest volume, I recognized the café in Kyoto, so it felt super real. By the way, I love sushi from Hokuriku. Which sushi topping do you like best—white shrimp?”

**(00:51:23)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** White shrimp is delicious—Toyama is known for that, along with winter yellowtail (kan-buri). But if I must pick, I love crab and sea urchin (uni).

**(00:52:37)**

(Reading) “Mitsumi-chan has the same birthday as me, March 3rd! Why that date?”

**(00:52:55)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Because it’s **Hinamatsuri (Doll’s Festival)** day in Japan, which sounds cute. Also, **Kankichi Ryotsu** from **Kochikame** shares that birthday, and I love the contrast. (laughs)

For the other characters, their birthdays were decided based on the overall vibe or personality I imagined for each of them.

(Reading) “What’s your monthly routine for creating manga? Also, I’d love Nao-chan merch, please!”

**(00:53:14)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Nao-chan merch would be awesome! Basically, I spend about two weeks on storyboards (the ‘name’) and two weeks on the actual drawing each month. If the name takes too long, then I have less time for drawing, and it’s chaos. But that’s the general cycle.

**(00:54:39)**

(Reading) “Congratulations on your signing. I love the bonus manga in your covers. Which manga, novels, or films are you into?”

**(00:54:52)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I have so many favorites. Lately, I’m rereading fantasy titles like **Made in Abyss** and **Dungeon Meshi (Delicious in Dungeon)**. For novels, I like **Miyabe Miyuki**, and of course I read **Harry Potter**. As for films, I love the classics: **The Shawshank Redemption**, **The Silence of the Lambs**, **Gattaca**, **Shall We Dance?** Ghibli films too—especially **Princess Mononoke**.

**(00:56:25)**

(Reading) “Your emotional portrayals are so good. How did you train your observation or verbalization skills? I’m an aspiring artist too.”

**(00:56:58)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you. I didn’t specifically train in observing. In my teens, I was just super anxious about what people thought, so I ended up over-analyzing everything. That might help me now as a creator, ironically. Also, reading many books broadens your vocabulary for describing emotions. I’m sorry I don’t have a more systematic method—it’s just how it went for me.

**(00:58:52)**

(Reading) “Now that a new chapter is coming, is there anything you want us to focus on or any big plans?”

**(00:59:20)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I’m not really one to say “Huge arc incoming—stay tuned!” But from a school calendar standpoint, next is the culture festival, then exam season for college entrance. Since it’s a high-level academic school, they’ll get very serious about admissions. I do want to depict how each character thinks about their path after graduation, especially because Mitsumi came from the countryside wanting to become a government official. We can’t just fast-forward to “and then she graduated!” So I’ll do thorough research and depict it properly.

(Reading) “When you first heard someone call Skip and Loafer ‘Sukirō’ or ‘Skilow’, did it remind you of sushi?”

**(01:01:05)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Haha, yeah, it does sound a bit like “sushi.” (in sushi-ro). But it’s kind of catchy.

**(01:01:26)**

(Reading) “Mitsumi-chan is like a cat, Shima-kun is like a dog, even like Sato-chan (Satonosuke) and there are some animal motifs, but do other characters have motifs?”

**(01:01:36)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** No, not really. It’s not something I thought about for everyone. But somehow, Mitsumi and Shima-kun do give off cat-and-dog vibes, don’t they? It’s kind of interesting how that worked out.

**(01:01:59)**

(Reading) “Which Sanrio character do you like best?”

**(01:02:03)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** That’s tricky. Pompompurin is super cute, Keroppi is adorable, and I’m into Pekkle the Duck lately. I like the classic memo-pad crew.

**(01:02:30)**

(Reading) “I look forward to each new issue. Which tools do you use for drawing? I love how warm your art looks.”

**(01:02:36)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you! I use G-pen and maru-pen (both are dip pens). I draw characters with analog methods, but I switched to digital backgrounds when the pandemic forced my assistants to work remotely. Still, I plan to keep drawing characters by hand.

**(01:03:41)**

(Reading) “Thanks for hosting this signing. I love how everyone’s feelings are so relatable. When you show a character’s emotional shifts or facial expressions, do you have any special approach?”

**(01:03:56)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** What I keep in mind is that each character has different vocabulary and a different level of self-awareness. People differ in how well they grasp their own emotions. For instance, I imagine Mika is someone who thinks a lot in words, while Shima-kun, and recently Chieri-chan, or even Yuzu-chan, might be less adept at it. Some realize how they feel only after a time lag, while others can say, ‘I’m sad or angry for these reasons’ and know it right away. I try to ensure they don’t all reach understanding at the same pace, so I think, ‘For this character, maybe their resolution is about this level.’

**(01:05:03)**

(Reading) “I’m an older guy, but I love Skip and Loafer. Please keep it up.”

**(01:05:50)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you! Actually, some older fans came to the signing, too, saying, “I’m an old man—sorry.” But there’s no need to apologize. The magazine is **Monthly Afternoon**, which is seinen, so I hope folks of all ages can enjoy.

**(01:06:27)**

(Reading) “I’m job-hunting and feeling depressed, but Skip and Loafer is supporting me. Looking forward to Season 2 of the anime!”

**(01:06:39)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Right, job-hunting… yes, that can get you down. Just do your best, take breaks, and don’t beat yourself up. I hope you find a good job. Same with student life: the people at the center or the ones who succeed aren’t necessarily ‘correct.’ If you think back, there were plenty of people who weren’t in the spotlight but were still great. Whether or not you get hired, it’s… Sorry, I can’t say much more. Hang in there, but don’t overdo it. Eat tasty food and stay warm.

**(01:07:48)**

(Reading) “Good evening, sensei. Also, the donation campaign for Noto reached its goal!”

**(01:08:05)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Yes! We had that campaign where reading Chapter 1 would trigger a 100-yen donation for the earthquake-stricken area in **Noto** (in Ishikawa Prefecture), and thanks to everyone, we reached the target amount. It’s really nice for local folks to see it fully reached, so thank you so much.

(Reading) “What do you most value or refuse to compromise on in Skip and Loafer?”

**(01:08:53)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I try to avoid pushing my personal values onto the story, or painting only one viewpoint as correct. No matter how gentle or positive a story is, someone could feel hurt by something in it. But I still want to show many kinds of people with a fairly neutral eye, like “This kind of person also exists,” rather than labeling them good or bad.

**(01:10:52)**

(Reading) “I keep rewatching and rereading. I love the Shima & Reiki-kun dynamics. Will there be a focus on them?”

**(01:11:04)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** If there’s a reason to delve into their feelings, maybe. It’d be cute, right?

**(01:11:32)**

(Reading) “The **Comic Days app** recently added a comments section, and fans are going wild. Do you read it?”

**(01:11:37)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I didn’t realize there were comments! But I figure if I start lurking, people might feel too self-conscious to comment freely. So I won’t look. (laughs)

**(01:12:04)**

(Reading) “What’s something yummy you ate lately? I had **Godiva warabi-mochi chocolate** and was shocked.”

**(01:12:11)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Ooh, that sounds interesting. For me, I actually bought a **mochi-making machine** (a mini home appliance) recently. It’s about the size of a breadmaker, and you can make fresh mochi without getting flour everywhere. I did it with my niece and nephew, and it was so fun. Freshly pounded mochi is amazing! I hesitated to buy it, but it’s already paid for itself.

**(01:13:32)**

(Reading) “Mitsumi’s pets are named Omiso, Oshio, and Satonosuke (‘Miso - Soybean paste’, ‘Salt’, and ‘Sugar’). What’s the inspiration?”

**(01:14:05)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** They’re basically condiments. That’s all there is to it. (laughs)

(Mic-off glitch around 01:29:39)

**(01:29:39)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Wait, my mic was off again? How long? Ten minutes? I had no idea. Sorry if you missed some of what I said.

**(01:30:43)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I wanted to share something about the signing event: someone asked, “Any memorable moments?” And I mentioned that a few readers came up crying and said Skip and Loafer motivated them to change jobs or circumstances. It was touching and also overwhelming. Because while I understood in theory that a manga might encourage someone, it’s different when a real person stands in front of me, telling me how it inspired them to take action.

But truly, I believe they themselves already wanted that change—my manga just happened to be the nudge at that particular moment. It could have been anything else. They deserve credit for making the move, so I hope they feel proud.

**(01:35:17)**

(Reading) “When you visited Kanazawa for a lecture (she lectured in Kanazawa College of Art), where did you eat?”

**(01:35:29)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I posted photos from a café near my college called **Bonjin**, and I also went to **Oriental Brewing** (a craft beer bar). **Bonjin** is a place I used to visit in my student days. It’s become super popular now, but it still tastes the same.

**(01:36:24)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I said I’d finish by 11:00… and I was silent for ten minutes. I’m so sorry.

**(01:37:18)**

(Reading) “I discovered Skip and Loafer through the anime. During the anime production process, did you have any particular requests for the staff, like specific directions?”

**(01:37:28)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you. As for actual ‘requests,’ I didn’t really make any. The director, producers, scriptwriter—they held meetings, but I didn’t have anything in particular to say. Basically, I’m a total amateur about visuals or audio, so if I wondered, ‘Huh, how will this turn out?’ once it was finished, I’d say, ‘Oh, I see!’ I attended the voice recordings, so I should have heard them, yet hearing the final anime, I was like, ‘Oh, so that’s how that voice sounds when animated!’ It was different. I realized the professionals can see further ahead than I can.

At the start of production, about ‘please be mindful of this,’ I hardly said anything. Basically, I just didn’t want them to discriminate against a certain group or do something that’s obviously out of line—just basic stuff. Like, I didn’t want them to mock a certain category of people or turn them into a total caricature. I wanted them to keep various ‘types’ of people neutral. I believe that’s what I **(01:38:40)**

(Reading) “I’m from Toyama too. What’s your favorite Toyama food?”

**(01:38:43)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Definitely the fresh seafood. And I sometimes crave **masuzushi** (pressed trout sushi). But overall, I love sushi more than big rice bowls.

**(01:39:15)**

(Reading) “So many of your lines stand out. Are they from personal experience?”

**(01:39:20)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** No, many of them are not from my experiences at all. It’s hard to say, but basically all the characters are classmates, so age difference doesn’t matter. Fundamentally, if someone says, ‘You’re doing it wrong, do it this way,’ and they go, ‘Oh, you’re right,’ and then they change right away… that doesn’t happen in real life. So I try to avoid that.

How to put it? When you read manga, you do want to see some growth, but if it’s just ‘growth, growth’ it can be draining. Still, we do want change, right? But I believe that real transformation comes from the character themselves being convinced—not from being lectured by others. It’s tough for people to change. If someone just scolds them, can they suddenly change? Probably not. You have to accept it yourself. So that’s the structure I want: a story where they realize it on their own.

**(01:40:47)**

(Reading) “Are there adorable overseas goods for Skip and Loafer that we can get in Japan?”

**(01:40:52)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I’ve seen some really cute items from overseas, yes. I’m not sure about licensing, but it’d be nice if we could sell them here too.

**(01:42:31)**

(Reading) “When I look back on my high school days, I remember the sports festival, the school festival, the choir competition, and the ball game tournament. In Tsubame Nishi High School (your fictional school), they have a class match (sports) and a culture fest. No chorus festival or sports day. Why those events?”

**(01:42:43)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** In my mind, Tsubame Nishi might have a sports festival, but no choir competition. Or maybe they just skip the sports festival. (laughs) I specifically wanted to show the class match (which often happens early in the first year) and the culture fest (which tends to be later in the year). Those two felt like key events.

(Reading) “Do Mitsumi-chan and the others have theme songs?”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** No, they don’t. I’m not that knowledgeable about music, but now I’m curious—what songs do you think suit them? Let me know!

**(01:44:20)**

(Reading) “When I’m thinking up stories, I imagine them like a live-action movie in my head. But my friend says that manga panels appear in their head. Are you the type to think in manga from the planning stage?”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I wonder what type I am? I don’t really write a detailed plot. I usually go straight to storyboarding. I can’t organize my ideas with just a plot. I need to put them into storyboard form. But… maybe I’m more of a visual type? I think I imagine the movements.

**(01:44:59)**

(Reading) “Do you have any plans to release another LINE sticker set with the content from the current volumes?”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Not right now, but I’d like to, wouldn’t I? I think the current ones only go up to volume five. I’d like to find some good parts to include and do it again. But… maybe when there’s a special occasion?

**(01:45:33)**

(Reading) “I’m looking forward to Skip and Loafer university and working life editions.”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Who knows? We’ll see.

**(01:45:54)**

(Reading) “When drawing certain scenes—romantic or introspective—do you listen to any particular music?”

**(01:45:57)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** No, if I hear Japanese lyrics while I’m planning, I can’t focus. I usually work in silence. For finishing work (like tones), I’ll put on a drama or talk show in the background to keep me from getting restless. If you have suggestions for an **“image song,”** feel free to let me know, because I don’t have one myself.

**(01:46:24)**

(Reading) “What’s your New Year’s resolution?”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I signed up for a 12-month online English course and skipped two months, so I vow to resume and improve my English step by step!

**(01:47:42)**

(Reading) “I’m doing disaster recovery in Noto. It’s tough, but it motivates me being in the place you modeled after.”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you so much. Infrastructure is still being restored, so I know it’s challenging. Please take care of yourself.

**(01:48:06)**

(Reading) “How many days off do you get per week, and what do you do?”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I don’t have a strict ‘off-day.’ If I have a plan with a friend, that’s my off-day. So maybe around five off-days a month? Sometimes I give up drawing if I’m not productive. It ends up being about two ‘light workload’ days a week in total.

**(01:49:03)**

(Reading) “I promoted your manga to many people during the donation campaign! By the way, do you read other **Afternoon** titles?”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Yes, I read quite a few.

(Reading) “Have you ever slipped on snow?”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Yes, many times. (laughs)

**(01:49:34)**

(Reading) “Makoto is in the literature club, but chose a science track. That surprised me. Which subjects are each character good at?”

**(01:49:46)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Well, I imagine Makoto is someone who likes the humanities but is strong in science. Mitsumi, perhaps she’s good at classical Japanese or memorization. Shima-kun is not especially great at anything, maybe about average all around. Mika is definitely good at English. Yuzu… maybe also balanced. Mukai-kun is probably a science type. It’s a bit vague, but that’s how I see it.”

**(01:50:47)**

(Reading) “How do you think Mitsumi and friends will celebrate **Coming-of-Age Day**? Will they wear **furisode** kimonos, or do something unique?”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Well, local coming-of-age ceremonies can be interesting. Due to the earthquake, maybe they couldn’t do them, but in some towns, it varies. In the place that inspired Takojima, for example, there’s a little theater by the sea, and new adults (those turning 20) will perform something like kabuki, about a slender, stylish guy and a burly fisherman, with confetti—it’s really fun. Typically, it’s men only, but who knows in my version. (laughs)

**(01:52:18)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Oh, it’s already past 11 PM. I’ll go a bit longer since my mic was off for about 10 minutes, but I’ll wrap it up soon.

(Reading) “Were you more a loafers person or a sneakers person in high school?”

**(01:52:36)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I wore both, but on the first day, I wore loafers because it felt so ‘high school.’

(Reading) “Is the café in Kyoto from the story a real place?”

**(01:52:54)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Yes, it is. I just don’t know if I can name it publicly, but it’s definitely real.

(Reading) “What breed is your dog?”

**(01:53:11)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Oh, the breed of my dog is a **Maltese-Pomeranian mix**. Right, she’s super cute. I got her from a rescue. It’s almost been a year now.

**(01:53:39)**

(Reading) “Any favorite comedians?”

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I like **Nakagawa-ke (the Nakagawa Brothers)**, though I’m not super knowledgeable about comedy overall.

**(01:54:05)**

(Reading) “I love the composition in your pages—like in the newest volume where they cross a small river while discussing their futures. It was moving. How do you decide your layouts?”

**(01:54:29)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thank you. I actually have a bit of insecurity about my art, so hearing that makes me happy. As for composition, because it’s manga, rather than making it extremely elaborate, I focus on readability. For action, you might have really cool poses, but I try to keep things clear so you know what’s happening. I avoid doing anything too off-the-wall. I’d rather it be read smoothly without getting stuck than have a weird flashy panel that makes the reader pause.

As for panel layout or composition: in my head, things are pretty 2D—I can’t visualize super 3D scenes. But regarding paneling, since this is a print medium, there’s a left and right page. When you open it, which panel is most important? Even within a single page, where do I want the reader to focus, and where can they skim quickly? I use panel size, position, or the density of art to signal, ‘Here’s the main focal point, whereas you can breeze through this part.’ I try to arrange it so it’s somewhat intuitive.

**(01:56:25)**

(Brief mention of an earthquake in Kyushu)

**(01:57:00)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Everyone in Kyushu, please be careful.

**(01:57:19)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Everyone, please be careful.

**(01:57:24)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** I’ll start by watching the news.

**(01:57:43)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** It’s past 11:00, so thank you for listening.

**(01:57:57)**

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Happy New Year! I hope we can meet again at a signing event or some other event. Thank you for joining me tonight.

**(01:58:05)**

(Gentle sign-off)

**Takamatsu-sensei:** Thanks, everyone. Good night. Take care!
