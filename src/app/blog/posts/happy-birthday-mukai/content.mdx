The morning air felt lighter than usual. Mika noticed it the moment she stepped outside. The sky stretched clear, as if someone had rinsed it gently overnight. It wasn’t hot or cold — just that kind of soft morning where the streets still remembered the quiet of dawn. She had wrapped a small box in thin paper the night before, sitting at the kitchen table with only the sound of the fridge humming behind her. Now it was tucked safely inside her bag.

Mukai’s birthday wasn’t something he ever talked about. He never reminded people, never expected anything. In fact, last year, Mika only found out because his classmate had accidentally mentioned it two days late.

But this year, she remembered.

They met in front of the vending machine near the park. Mukai was there first, hands in his jacket pockets, watching the drinks scroll by behind the foggy glass. Mika saw the way his shoulders moved when he heard her footsteps — that tiny lift, not a greeting exactly, more like a quiet way of saying he knew she was there.

“Morning,” she said, stopping beside him. The sun hadn’t climbed too high yet. Its light came slanting through the trees, cutting across the pavement.

“Morning,” he replied. His voice always sounded like it had just woken up, even when it hadn’t.

She waited while he picked a can. Lemon soda. He always chose that, though he rarely drank it all.

“I know you don’t like surprises,” Mika said, pulling the small box from her bag. “But I thought... maybe this one’s okay.”

Mukai stared at the box for a second. Not with shock. Just... stillness. She handed it to him carefully, like it might slip through if either of them gripped too tight.

He didn’t open it. Just held it in his hands and looked down at it.

“You remembered,” he said.

“I did.”

“Thanks.”

They sat down on the low wall that lined the park’s edge. It was quiet enough to hear the cicadas starting to wake up, even though it was still early in the season. Mukai rested the box on his lap, untouched. He didn’t seem in a rush. Mika didn’t mind.

“Is it weird?” she asked.

“What?”

“Celebrating like this. Just us. Just... today.”

He shook his head slowly. “No. It’s kind of nice.”

The breeze moved the branches above them. Light flickered through the leaves, scattering soft shapes across the pavement. Neither of them spoke for a while.

When Mukai finally opened the box, he did it gently. Inside was a keychain — just a small one. A pressed flower sealed in clear resin, pale blue with white edges. It looked like something forgotten between the pages of an old book.

“It reminded me of you,” Mika said. “Not sure why.”

Mukai held it up to the light. The flower caught the sun like glass.

“It’s quiet,” he said. “But it stays.”

She looked down at her hands, unsure if that was a good thing or not.

Then Mukai turned slightly toward her. His voice was softer now, almost unsure.

“I don’t really like attention. But... when it’s you, I don’t mind being seen.”

Mika blinked. Her eyes stayed on the gravel, but her chest felt lighter, like something had shifted there.

“Happy birthday,” she said again, this time quieter.

Mukai didn’t say anything. But he nodded once, and in the stillness between them, that was enough.

The keychain swayed gently in his hand, catching the wind.
